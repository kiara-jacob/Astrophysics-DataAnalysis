Learning Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib in Python


Decided to experiment with some data analysis in Astronomy. 

Day 1: BASICS OF PYTHON
Day 2: Numpy, Pandas and Scipy (dabbled)
 - made some scatter plots and histograms using data on the planets in the solar system and 10 stars less than 15 light years from our Sun. Also experimented with some basic statistical tools like mean, median, mode etc.
Day 3: Matplotlib and Seaborn
